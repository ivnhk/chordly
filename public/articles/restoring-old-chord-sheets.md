# How to Restore Older Chord Sheets in Chordly

Accidentally deleted a chord sheet? Or maybe you want to go back to an earlier draft of a song?  
Chordly makes it easy to restore your work in two different ways.

## 1. Restoring a Previous Version
Each chord sheet keeps a history of its past versions.  
To go back to an earlier version:

1. Open the chord sheet you want to restore.  
2. Click the **Previous Versions** icon at the top of the page.

3. Browse through the saved versions and select the one you’d like to bring back.

This is useful if you’ve made changes you no longer want, but don’t want to lose the sheet entirely.

## 2. Restoring from the Bin
If you’ve deleted a chord sheet or set list, don’t worry—it’s not gone forever.  
Chordly stores deleted items in the **Bin** section of your library.

1. Open your **Library**.  
2. Go to the **Bin** page.  
3. Find the chord sheet or set list you want to bring back.  
4. Click **Restore** to move it back into your library.

This is perfect for recovering songs you thought you didn’t need anymore but later realised you do.
